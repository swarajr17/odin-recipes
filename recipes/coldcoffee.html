    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cold coffee is a refreshing beverage made by blending or mixing coffee with milk, sugar, and ice. It is a popular choice, especially during warmer months, for its cool and creamy texture combined with the rich flavor of coffee. 

        The drink typically starts with brewed coffee or espresso, which is then chilled or combined with cold milk. Sweeteners like sugar or flavored syrups can be added for a touch of sweetness. Ice cubes or crushed ice are blended with the coffee mixture to create a frothy, smooth consistency, or simply added to serve it over ice.
        
        Cold coffee can be customized with various toppings such as whipped cream, chocolate syrup, or a sprinkle of cocoa powder for extra indulgence. Variations like iced lattes or cold brew coffee offer different levels of intensity and flavor.
        
        Enjoyed as a quick pick-me-up or a relaxing treat, cold coffee is a versatile drink that combines the bold taste of coffee with a refreshing twist.</p>
