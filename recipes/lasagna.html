   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has gained worldwide popularity 
    for its rich, layered flavors. It is a baked pasta dish made up of alternating 
    layers of flat, wide pasta sheets, sauces, cheeses, and fillings. The pasta sheets
     are traditionally made from durum wheat flour and eggs. The dish typically 
     includes a tomato-based meat sauce or a vegetarian sauce, combined with cheeses
      like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Lasagna is assembled in layers and 
      baked in the oven until the top is golden and bubbly. It originated in Italy, 
      specifically in the Emilia-Romagna region, and has become a beloved comfort food around the world.</p>
